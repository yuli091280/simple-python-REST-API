requests may need to be installed
cherrypy is the framework used

index and mood_page are only used for testing
all they do is submit the correct request to the api
pip -install cherrypy	to install cherrypy
py server.py		to run server

The api allows a date to be specified when submitting mood, defaults to today if a date is not submitted
The api allows a date to be specified when getting mood, defaults to all days if no date is specified

specify date by /mood/(date)
(date) must be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
returns 404 if date is invalid, request is malformed, or date not found

when interacting with /mood, a session id must be provided as a cookie
the server will provide the cookie the first time anything is requested
/mood will return 401 if no id is provided or if the session indicated by the id is not a logged in user

when POST to /mood, json must be in the format of
{'mood':(mood)}
(mood) can be any string
additional entries beyond 'mood' will be ignored
server returns 400 if 'mood' is not in json

GET /mood should expect json with this structure:
{
	(date) {
		mood: [moods]
		streak: some int
	}
}
where (date) is the date in string, [moods] is a list of moods for that day
if GET /mood/(date), expect the following
{
	mood: [moods]
	streak: some int
}

pytest is used for both unit test and coverage
pytest and pytest-cov may need to be installed
run pip -install pytest 	to install pytest
run pytest -s -v test.py 	for test cases
