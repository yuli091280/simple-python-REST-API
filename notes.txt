cherrypy is the framework used

index and mood_page are only used for testing
all they do is submit the correct json to the api

py server.py		to run server
py client.py		for a simple test
pytest -s test.py	for pytest unit test

The api allows a date to be specified when submitting mood, defaults to today if a date is not submitted
The api allows a date to be specified when getting mood, defaults to all days if no date is specified

specify date by /mood/(date)
(date) must be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD

when POST to /mood, json must be in the format of
{'mood':(mood)}
(mood) can be any string

pytest is used for both unit test and coverage
pytest and pytest-cov may need to be installed

when date is malformed for /mood:
POST: defaults to today
GET: returns moods json as if there were no dates specified

when a specified date does not exist for /mood:
GET: returns 404
