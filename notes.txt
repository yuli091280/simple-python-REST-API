requests may need to be installed
cherrypy is the framework used

index and mood_page are only used for testing
all they do is submit the correct json to the api

while the api allows a date to be submitted, this is
for testing only. As such the streak system breaks if
a mood that was submitted has a earlier date than a
previously submitted mood. the api defaults to today
if a date is not submitted

pytest is used for both unit test and coverage
pytest and pytest-cov may need to be installed
