cherrypy is the framework used

pip install cherrypy	to install cherrypy
py server.py		to run server

index.html and mood_page.html are only used for testing
all they do is submit the correct request to the api

The api currently has 3 endpoints, /login /logout /mood
All communication with the api is done in json

a user may login by POSTing to /login the following json:
{
	'username': (username)
	'password': (password)
}
All other entries will be ignored, and the server returns 400 should either of these entries be missing
server returns 401 when authentication fails
premade users:
username: user1
password: password
username: user2
password: abc123
username: user3
password: qwerty

a user may logout by requesting /logout with any method
server returns 401 if the current user is not logged in

The api allows a date to be specified when submitting mood, defaults to today if a date is not submitted
The api allows a date to be specified when getting mood, defaults to all days if no date is specified

specify date by /mood/(date)
(date) must be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
returns 404 if date is invalid, request is malformed, or date not found

when interacting with /mood, a session id must be provided as a cookie
the server will provide the cookie the first time anything is requested
/mood will return 401 if no id is provided or if the session indicated by the id is not a logged in user

when POST to /mood, json must be in the format of
{'mood':(mood)}
(mood) can be any string
additional entries beyond 'mood' will be ignored
server returns 400 if 'mood' is not in json

GET /mood should expect json with this structure:
{
	(date) {
		mood: [moods],
		streak: some int
	},
	(another date) {
		mood: [moods],
		streak: some int
}
where the dates will be strings in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, [moods] is a list of moods for that day
if GET /mood/(date), expect the following
{
	mood: [moods]
	streak: some int
}

The most obvious problem with this project as it is now is the fact that it stores all user info in memory.
For a prouduction app anything stored inside user_database should instead be stored in a sql database.
I also did not bother to implement https, which is definitely a necessity should this gets deployed.
There are also several config changes that need to be made when deploying this api.
Such as not letting cherrypy emit stacktrace on error amoung other things.
I might also add support for xml if this were to become production.


pytest is used for both unit test and coverage
pytest and pytest-cov may need to be installed
run pip install pytest 		to install pytest
run pip install pytest-cov	to install pytest-cov
run pytest -s -v test.py 	for test cases

client.py is a simple tester before pytest was in place
